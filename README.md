Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This project demonstrates a basic cryptography technique known as the Caesar Cipher, which shifts each letter in a string by a specified number of places in the alphabet.

Features

	•	Encrypts plaintext using a Caesar Cipher.
	•	Decrypts ciphertext by reversing the shift.
	•	Preserves non-alphabetic characters (punctuation, numbers, spaces).
	•	Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Usage

	1.	Clone the repository or copy the script.
	2.	Run the script in Python.
	3.	Modify the plaintext and shift values as needed.

Example

Input

Plaintext: Hello, World!
Shift: 3

Output

Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog!
Decrypted: Hello, World!

How It Works

	•	Each letter in the plaintext is shifted forward in the alphabet by the specified shift value during encryption.
	•	During decryption, the same shift value is reversed to return to the original text.
	•	Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x

Running the Script

	1.	Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
	2.	Save the script as caesar_cipher.py.
	3.	Open a terminal and navigate to the script’s location.
	4.	Run the script:

python caesar_cipher.py
